FenrirFS is a fantastic software to achieving files with which I manage all of my Doujinshi. 
All meta data, such as file path and alias, are saved in files and sqlite database in form of absolute path. 
Sometimes, I want to backup my Doujinshi to another disk in which case FenrirFS doesn't work any more.
So this script does all things for data migration and backup. It just applies absolute path change to meta data.
